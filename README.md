## Description

Why I decided to create a full-project to just my curriculum vitae? Please allow me to explain you more about me... I just really love coding, mostly about this is a project for allowing people interested in my work just can see the easy way for coding a simple solution.

**This is not another web page to simply show my experience** It goes way beyond a simple curriculum vitae. It contains a full stack Javascript way to develop this solution. 

- A Client side for the curriculum 
- A Server side for the request of the contact form and more...
- Another Client side app that allows to administrate the curriculum requests

**NOTE:** Please remember to star this project to get new versions updates of this template.

## Support CoreUI Development
